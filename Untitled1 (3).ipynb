    "Q1. What is a projection and how is it used in PCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "A projection is a linear transformation that maps a vector onto a subspace, typically of lower dimension, while preserving certain properties of the original vector. In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), projections are used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. The goal is to capture the most significant variance in the data along new axes called principal components."

    "\n",
    "The optimization problem in PCA involves finding the principal components that maximize the variance in the data. Mathematically, PCA aims to find a set of orthogonal unit vectors (principal components) such that when the data is projected onto these vectors, the variance of the projected data is maximized. This is achieved by solving an eigenvalue problem or through singular value decomposition."

The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, and the eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of variance along those directions."

If some dimensions have high variance and others have low variance, PCA tends to focus on the dimensions with high variance, effectively reducing the dimensionality while preserving the most important information in the data. This is particularly useful in capturing the dominant patterns in the data."
